	<p>There are two web pages in total for our draft:</p>
	<p> <a href= "page_search.html"> This page where you can search our data base by shooting case criteria</a>
	 and <a href="page_map.html"> this page where you can navigate by clicking on a US map.</a>

	<p>Hopefully you'll enjoy our design!</p>
