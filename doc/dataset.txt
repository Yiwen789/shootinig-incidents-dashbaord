Description: 

This dataset contains information of incident detail, location, and victim information of every fatal shooting by an on-duty office in the United States since 2015. 
These information include fatality information, where did the shooting take place? Were the victims armed? Were the officers wearing body cams? and basic information
 of the victims such as race, age, gender, etc.

User Stories:

STORY: As an activist against racism/researcher, I can get the demographic information of victims of nationwide police shooting data or data of a specific state. 
I can compare the proportion of victims by race and gender to determine if there are racial disparities among victims and hence evaluate how racism might be 
behaving in the local police department. 

IMPLEMENTATION: We can get a map of the country and the user could hover over to get quick summary data (e.g. total # of shooting events in the database, ratio 
of black/hispanic victims...). We may colorcode the states depending on the number of shootings. The user can click the state to get into a page with listed 
detailed information.
There we will have a drop-down list to let the user select between show/filter. It will have a default of “Not Specified”. If the user selects one of “show”
 and “filter”, a new drop-down appears to let the user choose what to show/filter, where choices are the column names, also “Not Specified” by default. Again, 
if this is specified, another drop-down appears with classifications of the column. The user can also choose to add additional lists at the second/third stages, 
to enable multiple choices. 

========================================================================

STORY: As a police officer, I can get a list of the detailed situations of past police shooting events (e.g. whether the suspects were armed / fleeing) similar 
to my specified case, to help me better decide what actions to take during law enforcement in the future.

IMPLEMENTATION: We’ll have a drop-down list of choices for each of the following six categories from table “incidents” : signs of mental illnesses, threat level,
 flee, manner of death, armed, arms category. We’ll search in our data for matching cases, and print out a list of each single event with some simple statistics.

========================================================================

STORY: As a US resident who is considering moving to a new state, I want to find out the police of which states are more friendly to people and at least not 
shooting people for unsubstantiated reasons.

IMPLEMENTATION: We can get a map of the country and the user could hover over to get quick summary data (e.g. total # of shooting events in the database, ratio of
 black/hispanic victims, ratio of armed status undetermined...). We may colorcode the states depending on the number of shootings or number of shootings per capita.

========================================================================

STORY: As someone interested in finding out whether the number of police shootings has increased over the years, or if the demographics of participants in the 
police shootings has evolved over the years, I can get a graph representing the number of shootings by time. 

IMPLEMENTATION: We can create a dropdown menu that allows the user to select a type of data they want to know (e.g. total number of shootings, total number of 
fatal shootings, proportion of POC in the shootings) and then display the data by a timeframe of their choice (e.g. day, month of year, year). The user can also 
use a dropdown menu to select a state they are interested in and view data of the selected state.
